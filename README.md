## About
  * Our group will be using the dataset regarding Starbucks customer segmentation. We will divide the customers into groups so that they can be marketed to and will use the variables like gender, age, income, etc. We plan to utilize chi squared analysis, K-nearest neighbors, and regression analysis in order to validate our findings.
